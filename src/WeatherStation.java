 * Class for a simple computer based weather station that reports the current
 * temperature (in Celsius) every second. The station is attached to a sensor
 * that reports the temperature as a 16-bit number (0 to 65535) representing the
 * Kelvin temperature to the nearest 1/100th of a degree.
 *
 * This class is implements Runnable so that it can be embedded in a Thread
 * which runs the periodic sensing.
